# The problems


arxiv problemsï¼š
1. searching by name for papers and authors sometimes response nothing. So I search the paper with paper ID, but I haven't found a good way to search authors except their names.
2. Sometimes the arxiv's connection is refused. But it is very rare. So I save the crawled result frequently. Next time it continues crawling the arxiv based on the saved result.
